======

**NOTE**: This repo has been broken down into individual projects under

All that remains in this repo are tools for development and deployment.

A Python based distributed job system which is intended to be easy to deploy
and maintain.  Initially developed to be used solely by the Visual Effects

general scientific community.  Currently the project is undergoing heavy
development and this page serves as a placeholder.  For more direct information
