roots:
  windows: F:\

# Root locations or templates for specific types
# of logs.  Please note that '/' should always be used
# as a separator regardless of platform.  Internally
# the preferences module will split these paths by '/' then
# recombine them with the proper separator.

# Default Template Variables:
#   $temp - determined by tempfile.gettempdir()
#   $root - determined by roots[datatypes.OSNAME]
#
# Variables which are not defined above but included below
# would be substituted when the log is created.  For example $jobid or
# $frame would be included when a new job starts on a host
locations:
  general: $root/log
  jobs: $root/log/jobs/$jobid/$frame.log
